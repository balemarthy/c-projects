The strategy of every datastructure learning is as follows:


1. Start with the basic operations of the datastructure.
2. A datastructure primarily should provide mechanism to add, remove, search elements
3. Seen in other way, the basic operations should enable datastructure to expand, shrink, and examine it.
4. Any other operation beyond this will use these basic operations
5. The tricky questions or so called "interview questions" will be added in respective folders
